      <p>I have spent the last 14 years working in the outdoor retail industry.  On top of that, I spent 9 years running and developing programs at a community center that absolutley opened my eyes and made me a better person.</p>

      <p>Technology has always been my first love and always came naturally to me. When I was a child, I would tell people I wanted to build computers.  I fondly rememeber convincing my parents to pull the intercom things off the wall of our townhouse so I could see how the inside was put together. (I could just yell down to the main floor and I dont even know if they ever worked in my life)</p>

      <p>So full circle...I see myself now building the brain of the computer. I am so excited for this adventure ahead!</p>
